# Demo data

`prisma/seed-demo.ts` wipes the database and rebuilds it with a realistic,
lived-in dataset — three houses, five vehicles, thirty pieces of equipment, and
several years of service history, warranties, and reminders behind them. It
exists so the app can be screenshotted with content that looks like somebody
actually uses it.

Every date is written **relative to the moment you run it**. Re-running in six
months refreshes the whole timeline: what was overdue is overdue again, "due
soon" is soon again, and recent service is recent again. Nothing goes stale.

---

## ⚠️ It wipes everything

This is not additive. Before it writes anything it deletes:

- every property, vehicle, and piece of equipment
- every service record, warranty, maintenance reminder, and attachment
- every notification
- **every user account, including yours**
- every uploaded file under `UPLOAD_DIR`

It prints a row count and the exact database and uploads paths it is about to
destroy, then waits for you to type `WIPE`. Anything else aborts without
touching a thing. If stdin isn't a terminal it refuses outright rather than
guessing.

**Do not point this at anything but a local development database.**

---

## Running it

```bash
npm run db:seed:demo
```

or directly:

```bash
npx tsx prisma/seed-demo.ts
```

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--yes` / `-y` | Skip the confirmation prompt. Required for non-interactive shells. |
| `--no-images` | Skip photo lookup entirely and use generated placeholders. Fast. |
| `--refresh-photos` | Ignore the photo cache and re-download everything. |

Environment overrides:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `file:./prisma/dev.db` | Which database gets wiped. |
| `UPLOAD_DIR` | `./uploads` | Where asset photos and attachments are written. |
| `DEMO_EMAIL` | `demo@homecenter.local` | Login created by the seed. |
| `DEMO_PASSWORD` | `demo1234` | Password for that login. |
| `DEMO_NAME` | `Alex Rivera` | Display name, shown in the header and on records. |
| `DEMO_PHOTO_CACHE` | `prisma/.demo-photos` | Where downloaded photos are cached. |

### Signing in afterwards

The wipe deletes all users, so the script creates one and prints it when it
finishes:

```
demo@homecenter.local  /  demo1234
```

It is created as an ADMIN with `mustResetPassword` off, so it drops straight
onto the dashboard — no password-change interstitial in your screenshots.

## What you get

| | |
|---|---|
| **3 properties** | Maple Street House (primary), Lake Cabin (seasonal), Cedar Street Rental (tenant-occupied) |
| **5 vehicles** | RAV4, Civic, F-150, Outback, Odyssey — with mileage, VINs, and mileage-based reminders |
| **30 equipment** | Spread 14 / 9 / 7 across the three houses: appliances, HVAC, water, tools, outdoor, security |
| **38 service records** | Spanning about two years, six of them in the last 30 days so "Recent Service" isn't empty |
| **16 warranties** | 3 expired, 3 expiring within 60 days, the rest comfortably active, 1 deliberately unknown |
| **24 reminders** | 3 overdue, 5 due within 30 days, the rest further out |
| **12 attachments** | Generated PDF invoices and warranty certificates, so records show paperclip counts |
| **People** | Two people (the demo user and a child), three providers, a managed condition with a medication due for refill, a severe penicillin allergy, two insurance policies (one expiring within 60 days), five visits with PDF receipts, and two health reminders |

The mix is deliberate: the dashboard's "Upcoming Maintenance" and "Expiring
Warranties" panels both have content, warranty and maintenance status filters
each match something, and the service list has enough rows to page through.

Equipment is linked to properties, so the equipment list's Property column and
the property filter are both meaningful.

## Photos

Photos come from **Wikimedia Commons**, searched per item ("Toyota RAV4", "sump
pump", "gas furnace"). They're real photographs, subject-matched, and — unlike
the usual placeholder services — carry no watermark or attribution bar burned
into the pixels.

Wikimedia rate-limits anonymous traffic, so the script makes its requests one at
a time with backoff. **The first run takes a couple of minutes.** Downloads are
then cached in `prisma/.demo-photos/` (gitignored), so every later run is
effectively instant and works offline. `--refresh-photos` re-downloads.

If a lookup fails or you pass `--no-images`, the item falls back to a generated
gradient image so the layout still holds together.

Commons files are freely licensed but individual files carry individual licenses
(CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, public domain, and others). That's fine for local screenshots
and demos. If a screenshot is going somewhere public where attribution matters,
check the license on the specific file, or swap in your own photos.

---

## Refreshing months later

Just run it again:

```bash
npm run db:seed:demo
```

The photo cache means it won't re-download, and every date is recomputed from
today. You get the same dataset with a freshly relevant timeline.

## Relationship to `prisma/seed.ts`

They are different tools and don't overlap:

| | `db:seed` (`prisma/seed.ts`) | `db:seed:demo` (`prisma/seed-demo.ts`) |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Bootstrap a real install | Fill a dev database for screenshots |
| Destructive | No — it no-ops if an admin exists | Yes — wipes everything first |
| Creates | One admin user | A full dataset with photos and history |
| Safe on real data | Yes | **No** |
